    <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20240106779A1/en?oq=17%2f934%2c639" target="_blank">See patent</a>
    <p>
      The patent discusses a method and system for managing and exchanging message channel data based on user-specified parameters. It involves receiving parameters from both data providers and recipients, using a matching engine to identify compatible data exchanges, and processing the data accordingly. The system segments the data into permitted and non-permitted portions based on the providers' parameters and delivers the allowed segments to the recipients who match the criteria. Compensation is also initiated for the data providers according to their terms. This method aims to balance the privacy preferences of data providers with the data needs of recipients, allowing for tailored data exchanges in an online environment.

    <strong>System and method for verified predictions and performance</strong>
    <p>US2024070201A1 · Filed Aug 31, 2022</p>
    <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20240070201A1/en?oq=17%2f900%2c437" target="_blank">See patent</a>
    <p>
      The "System and Method for Verified Predictions and Performance" enhances prediction reliability by creating a communication chain of independent units, each dedicated to specific prediction services for designated prompts. This innovative framework addresses the limitations of traditional prediction markets, such as their ethical concerns and complex payout structures, by leveraging network-based technology for rapid and widespread information dissemination.
      <br><br>
      Key features include:
      <br><br>
      Modular Chain Units: Each unit independently manages prediction services related to specific prompts, ensuring scalability and efficient resource management.
      <br>
      Dynamic Request Handling: Requests for prediction services are either directed to an existing unit associated with a specific query prompt or lead to the creation of a new unit tailored to the query, enhancing responsiveness and specificity.
      <br>
      Verification and Validation: The system emphasizes the verification of predictions to enhance their credibility, crucial in an era where digital information can be ambiguous.
      <br><br>
      The system is designed to not only facilitate the generation and management of predictions but also ensure their accuracy through structured verification processes. Users can interact with various operations such as submitting predictions, requesting verifications, and accessing validated predictions in real-time.
      <br><br>
      Overall, this invention provides a robust solution to the challenges of maintaining accuracy and trust in digital predictions, making it particularly valuable across various sectors including finance, weather forecasting, and social media analytics. It represents a significant advancement in the field of data verification and management.
